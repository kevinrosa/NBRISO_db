# Monday Oct 19, 2015:
* finished proposal [for Cynthia's class]
* renamed repository to NBRISO_db (from NBRIS_db)
* made a first logo
* began learning some SQL

# Thursday Oct 15, 2015:
* began daily_updates.md file
* made further changes to the info_tcm_*.csv files.  Will now be using yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS format for times instead of Matlab datenum.  Figured this change would improve human readability as well as cross-platform machine readability.  For 2014, I also went through and updated time_end to reflect recovery date. 
* 

TO DO:
- [ ] choose naming scheme for adcp data (make sure to account for moored vs. underway)
